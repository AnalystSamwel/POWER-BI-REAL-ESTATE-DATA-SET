# 🏡 Real Estate Data Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)

## 📌 Project Overview

I was tasked with performing an end-to-end analysis on a real estate dataset using Power BI.  
The objective was to extract actionable insights into property listings, market trends, agent performance, and sales/rental behavior to support data-driven decision-making in real estate.
